## Inspiration

What inspired us to make Pybooks was the fact that there are so many students that are seeking to learn efficiently but the issue is with other digital textbook solutions such as zybooks, students have to pay with their tuition while professors are not able to provide the best educational experience as they cannot manipulate the textbook the way they want it to teach the students as best as possible.

## What it does

Pybooks allows teachers to make their own interactive textbook solutions for their students so they can provide the best teaching experience possible for them. On the other end, students are able to learn from text articles, multiple choice questions, and even a coding IDE implemented directly within the browser!

## How we built it

The way we approached building our software was by using React to build out the structure and functionality of our front end while using Django to build out the back end functionality and structure. We also used pyodide to make sure python ran in the browser and also used restAPIs to ensure proper functionality on both the front and back ends.

## Challenges we ran into

The biggest challenge we ran into was making sure python was running within the browser in our front end. The issue with it was that the pyodide function was not being called. Another difficulty we ran into was making the teacher dashboard to make sure to had more features than the students. Finally, the last difficulty we were facing was making sure the log in and sign in pages were working properly.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

The accomplishments we are proud of the fact that we were able to make python run on the browser, got JWT authentication, and integrate React successfully with Django.

## What we learned

The main things we learned was how to use React properly to make aesthetic pages within our software, how to use pyodide to make sure that python runs into the browser, and how to use Django to make an interactive backend that has sufficient functionality on all ends.
